# Contributing to restViz

Thank you for considering contributing to `restViz`! Your input is highly appreciated and helps make this project better for everyone.

### Base Contributions on the development Branch
**Important**: ```Always branch off from development — not main.```

All new ```features```, ```bug fixes```, and ```documentation``` updates should be based on the development branch. Pull requests targeting main will be closed or asked to be retargeted.

# How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Create a new branch off of development**

   *Example*:
      - git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode origin/development
   
      - Use meaningful branch names
   
      - fix/spelling-error, feature/add-dark-mode, docs/update-readme

3. **Commit with clear messages**

4. **Push to your fork**

5. **Submit a Pull Request targeting the development branch**
